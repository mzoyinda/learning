                Engineers are problem solvers. They come up with solutions and technologies to address societal problems. In the 19th century, we had the industrial revolution which, amongst others, included the birth of the modern car and electricity industry. At the
                turn of the 20th century, we became able to fly across the oceans with the invention of the airplane. The 21st century came along with the internet; an engineering marvel that is revolutionizing the way we interact and conduct businesses
                with one another. From being able to fly to being able to move from one place to another more quickly and more effectively to being able to perform tasks with less resources and more efficiently, the engineer has always been at the center
                of helping mankind solve their most pressing problems.

                Even as the world faces untold challenges of poverty, healthcare, security, housing, climate change etc., there is no other time we needed the presence of the engineer in our world more than now. Whether it is optimizing processes or products for better
                performance or cost reduction, or improving environmental footprints of designs for existing products and processes, or the creation of completely new solutions, the engineerâ€™s role in problem solving is as diverse as the range of problems
                affecting humanity today.
