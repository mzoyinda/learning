                        <p class="content">In 2016, the UNICEF reported that women and girls spend 200 million hours or over 22,800 years every day to collect water. A colossal waste of valuable time, the report said. Such needlessly and excessively lost times could have
                            been invested into other productive endeavors as people strive to get out of poverty in the 21st century.

                            Paoua, a town in Central African Republic, is one area where people are faced with such water crisis with its attendant loss of man-hours.

                        <p class="content">In Paoua, people spend over 500 hours a day to collect water from a water reservoir located towards its outskirt; about 6 km away from the center of the town. You are among a team of engineers that has been assigned the responsibility
                            of designing an underground water channel system to transport water from the reservoir to a central location in Paoua where people could readily go to collect water. As a key member of the team, your individual task specifically
                            is to determine the diameter of the pipes needed.
